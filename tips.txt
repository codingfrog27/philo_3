1 thread for printing

2 can init philos be a bzero type of function?
3 add malloc fail protection to init philos





data structure questions:

-right now data has an array of philo structs, is this the right way to go about it?







-compiling with sanitize thread
-


-have monitor and printing thread


-have 1 wirting mutex that gets locked every time u wanna msg, and only get ur timestamp after
locking that mutex



-left off at


21-08 went back after nother break, is confusing, at starting simulation now




print lock should be one singular shared cause its to stop printing getting
mixed up

quintescential== meal lock (per philo), 1 per for, 1print lock


use pthread join instead of sleep (or detach(if i do use detach wait
sleep arg time))
